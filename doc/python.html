    <p>The Boost Graph Library offers a wealth of graph algorithms and
    data types for C++. These algorithms are flexible and efficient,
    but the mechanisms employed to achieve this goal can result in
    long compile times that slow the development cycle.</p>

    <p>The Python bindings are build using the <a
    href="../../python/doc">Boost.Python</a> library. The bindings are
    meant to strike a balance of usability, flexibility, and
    efficiency, making it possible to rapidly develop useful systems
    using the BGL in Python.</p>

    <h2><a name="caveats">Caveats and Warnings</a></h2>
    <p>The Python bindings for the Graph library are experimental at
    this time. The bindings may not work (but they probably do) and we
    will not attempt to provide backward compatibility if the
    interfaces change. If you have any ideas </p>

    <h2><a name="building">Building the Python Bindings</a></h2>
    <p>To build the Python bindings, change to
    the <tt>libs/graph/build/python</tt> subdirectory of Boost and
    then follow the <a
    href="../../../more/getting_started.html#Build_Install">Boost
    Build Instructions</a> to build the Python extension module. The
    end result will be a dynamic library (DLL, .so, etc.) that can be
    loaded into Python via "<tt>import bgl</tt>". <b>Note</b>: For
    this build to succeed, the graph library must work flawlessly on
    the compile, <i>including the new GraphViz parser</i>, which tends
    to break many compilers. Visual C++ 7.1 and recent versions of the
    GCC and Intel compilers are known to work.</p> 


    <h2><a name="goals">Goals</a></h2>
    <p>The goal of the BGL-Python bindings is to create a set of
    bindings for the majority of the BGL in Python that:
    <ul>
      <li>"Feel" like the BGL, but with Python syntax.</li>
      <li>Allow rapid prototyping of algorithms for the BGL.</li>
      <li>Allow easy porting from the BGL in Python to the BGL in
      C++.</li>
      <li>Permit the use of the BGL in applications for which C++ is
      not particularly well suited.</li>
      <li>Strike a balance between simplicity, usability, and
      efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>Note that one goal we did not list is that the Python syntax be
    perfect for Python. For instance, one might implement a graph
    library in Python very differently from the way the BGL is
    implemented in C++, and the Python version may be syntactically
    superior. Nonetheless, having a strong syntactic correlation
    between the BGL in C++ and the BGL in Python is important for this
    project. It is <b>strongly</b> recommended that you build with
    release mode, e.g., <tt>bjam -sBUILD=release</tt>.</p>

    <h2><a name="example1">A First Example</a></h2>
    <p>Our <a
              href="../example/python/biconnected_components.py">first
              example</a> illustrates the use of BGL graphs, graph
              algorithms, and property maps from Python. The initial
      step is to load the BGL-Python bindings:</p>
    <pre>
from bgl import *
    </pre>

    <p>Next, we load a GraphViz file containing the description of a
      sample graph. The <tt>Graph</tt> type is an undirected
      graph; <tt>file_kind</tt> is an enumerator with only two
      potential values: <tt>adjlist</tt>, for an adjacency-list
      representation, or <tt>graphviz</tt>, for a GraphViz file.</p>

    <pre>
g = Graph("biconnected_components.dot", file_kind.graphviz)
    </pre>

    <p>Assuming no exceptions have been thrown, we will have an
      undirected graph loaded. We can immediately
      call <tt>biconnected_components</tt> to compute the biconnected
      components within the graph:</p>

    <pre>
art_points = biconnected_components(g, g.get_edge_int_map("label"))
    </pre>
    
    <p>There are several interesting parts of the preceeding line. We
    call the <a
    href="biconnected_components.html"><tt>biconnected_components</tt></a>
    algorithm with two parameters. The first is just the graph
    itself. The second parameter is a property map from edges to an
    integer value, which will be stored in the graph under the name
    "label". Finally, the return value
    of <tt>biconnected_components</tt> is a Python list containing the
      articulation points of the graph.</p>

    <p>Other kinds of property maps are available. In this case, we
    create two property maps attaching strings to the vertices of the
    graph. We then iterate over all vertices of the graph to set
    default values for each vertex property.</p>

    <pre>
v_color = g.get_vertex_string_map("fillcolor") 
v_style = g.get_vertex_string_map("style") 
for v in g.vertices: 
  v_color[v] = "white" 
  v_style[v] = "filled"
    </pre>

    <p>Lastly, we mark all of the articulation points red and write
    out the result in GraphViz format.</p>

    <pre>
for v in art_points:
  v_color[v] = "red"

g.write_graphviz("biconnected_components_out.dot")
    </pre>

    <h2><a name="documentation">Documentation style</a></h2> <p>The
    Python bindings for the Boost Graph Library retain essentially the
    same syntax. Because of this, there is no separate documentation
    for the BGL in Python: each BGL component (algorithms, data
    structures, etc.) available in Python will be marked with the
    Python symbol <img src="figs/python_ico.gif"
    alt="(Python)">. Unless an explicit <b>Python</b> section (or
    field) is present, the Python versions have precisely the same
    semantics as the C++ version.</p>

    <h3><a name="graph_types"/>Graph types</h3> 

    <p>The C++ Boost Graph Library provides several graph types that
    permit the generation of a huge number of specific graph types. In
    Python, the BGL only exposes two general-purpose graph
    types: <tt>Graph</tt> and <tt>Digraph</tt>, for undirected and
    directed graphs, respectively. Both graph types are part of
    the <tt>bgl</tt> extension module for Python. These graph types
    are one-size-fits-most, offering stable vertex and edge
    descriptors and a core set of operations from the <a
    href="adjacency_list.html"><tt>adjacency_list</tt></a> class
    template. The following sections briefly describe the operations
    that can be performed on both the <tt>Graph</tt>
    and <tt>Digraph</tt> Python graph types, although the
    documentation uses <tt>Graph</tt> in the description.</p>

    <p>Unlike the C++ graph types in the BGL, the Python graph types
    use object-oriented syntax. For
    instance, <tt>num_vertices(g)</tt> retrieves the number of
    vertices in graph <tt>g</tt> in C++, whereas the Python
    equivalent is <tt>g.num_vertices()</tt>. All of the graph
    operations described in the following text are methods of the
    graph type.</p>

    <h4><a name="types"/>Types</h4>
<pre>Graph.Vertex</pre>
<blockquote>
The type of a vertex descriptor in the graph <tt>Graph</tt> that will
be used to refer to vertices in the graph. Note that there may be
several Python objects that refer to the same vertex, which can be 
compared with <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> correctly.<br>
<b>Bug</b>: Vertex descriptors do not work properly when used in a
Python <tt>dict</tt>.
</blockquote>

<pre>Graph.Edge</pre>
<blockquote>
The type of a edge descriptor in the graph <tt>Graph</tt> that will
be used to refer to edges in the graph. Note that there may be
several Python objects that refer to the same edge, which can be
compared with <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> correctly.<br>
<b>Bug</b>: Edge descriptors do not work properly when used in a
Python <tt>dict</tt>.
</blockquote>

    <h4><a name="constructors"/>Constructors</h4>
<pre>Graph()</pre>
<blockquote>
Constructs an empty graph.
</blockquote>

<pre>Graph(edges, name_map = "")</pre>
<blockquote>
Constructs a graph from a list of edges. <tt>edges</tt> should be a
Python sequence, the elements of which should be 2-tuples containing
the source and target of the edge. The sources and targets can be of
any type that has a less-than operator defined, e.g., strings or
integers. If a non-empty string is provided for <tt>name_map</tt>,
a <tt>vertex_object_map</tt> will be created that maps from the
vertices that are created to the name used in the list of edges.
</blockquote>

<pre>Graph(filename, kind)</pre>
<blockquote>
Constructs a graph from an external file using one of the Boost Graph
Library's graph parsers. <tt>filename</tt> is a string containing the
file name. <tt>kind</tt> is an value of type <tt>bgl.file_kind</tt>,
which has one of the following values:
<ul>
<li><tt>bgl.file_kind.adjlist</tt>: Reads an adjacency-list
representation into the graph. In the file, each line represents a
single edge. On that line will be the source and target of the edge,
separated by one or more spaces.</li>
<li><tt>bgl.file_kind.graphviz</tt>: Reads a <a
href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> DOT file into the
graph. The DOT file must represent a graph that is directed (for
a <tt>Digraph</tt>) or undirected (for a <tt>Graph</tt>). See <a
href="#read_graphviz"><tt>read_graphviz</tt></a> for additional details.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<pre>Graph(generator, seed)</pre>
<blockquote>
Constructs a graph using the random generator <tt>generator</tt> and
random seed value <tt>seed</tt> (an integer). The <tt>generator</tt>
parameter may be one of three things:
<ul>
  <li><tt>bgl.<a href="erdos_renyi_generator.html">ErdosRenyi</a>(n, p)</tt>: Generates a graph
  with <tt>n</tt> vertices and a probability <i>0 &lt;= <tt>p</tt> &gt;=
  1</i> of having an edge between any two vertices <tt>u</tt>
  and <tt>v</tt>.</li>

  <li><tt>bgl.<a href="small_world_generator.html">SmallWorld</a>(n, k, p)</tt>: Generates a small-world graph
  with <tt>n</tt> vertices, each of which is connected to
  its <tt>k</tt> nearest neighbors (assuming one places the vertices
  in a circle). With probability <tt>p</tt>, each edge in the graph is
  randomly rewired.</li>

  <li><tt>bgl.<a href="plod_generator.html">PowerLawOutDegree</a>(n, alpha, beta)</tt>: Generates a
  scale-free graph using the Power Law Out Degree model
  with <tt>n</tt> vertices. Each vertex has degree <i>beta *
  x<sup>-alpha</sup></i>, where <i>x</i> is a random value between 0
  and <i>n-1</i>. The value of <i>beta</i> controls the y-intercept of the
  curve, so that increasing <i>beta</i> increases the average degree of
  vertices. The value of <i>alpha</i> controls how steeply the curve drops
  off, with larger values indicating a steeper curve. The web graph,
  for instance, has <i>alpha ~ 2.72</i>.</li>
</ul>

be removed from the property maps attached to the graph.
</blockquote>

<pre>remove_vertex(v)</pre>
<blockquote>
Removes the vertex <tt>v</tt> from the graph. Before invoking this

    <h3><a name="algorithms"/>Algorithms</h3>

    <p>All algorithms available in Python operate only on the Python
    graph types supplied by the BGL-Python bindings and are not
    generic in the same sense as their C++ counterparts. However,
    unless marked otherwise, their parameters are still customizable
    from Python. See, for instance, <a
    href="breadth_first_search.html"><tt>breadth_first_search</tt></a>,
    which can still be provided with a customized queue and visitor
    from within Python. </p>

    <p>All algorithms are in the <tt>bgl</tt> extension module, at the
    top level, and have the same names as in C++.</p>

    <p>The parameters of BGL functions exposed to Python have the same
    general data types, order, and names as in C++. If the BGL
    function takes named parameters, then the names of the parameters
    can be used for keyword arguments in Python. For instance:</p>
<pre>
// C++
betweenness_centrality(g, weight_map(weight).centrality_map(centrality));

# Python
bgl.betweenness_centrality(g, weight_map = weight, centrality_map = centrality);
</pre>

    <p>Unless otherwise specified, all parameters documented in C++
    are available in Python. If there are any differences, the
    parameter documentation will contain a <b>Python</b> line
    describing those differences. If the default in Python differs
    from the C++ default, the parameter documentation will contain
    a <b>Python default</b> line. Finally, if the algorithm's
    behavior is radically different in Python, the algorithm will
    contain a "Python" section. Although not available now, we would
    like to rewrite the C++ examples in Python and add a "Python
    Example" for each algorithm with inline examples.</p>
   
    <h3><a name="property_maps"/>Property Maps</h3> 

    <p>Property maps in Python allow the same <tt>[]</tt> operator
    syntax as Python dictionaries. For instance, if we have a property
    map <tt>rank</tt> mapping vertices to integers, we can increment
    the rank of vertex <tt>v</tt> with the following Python code:</p>
<pre>
rank[v] = rank[v] + 1
</pre>

    <p>However, unlike Python dictionaries one cannot enumerate the
    keys or values in a property map. Instead, you must enumerate the
    vertex or edges in the graph to index into the Python property
    map. This restriction follows from the C++ formulation of
    property maps, which do not allow such iteration.</p>

    <h2><a name="vis"/>A simple visualization tool</a></h2> 

    <p>The program <tt>vis.py</tt>, in the <tt>examples/python</tt>
    subdirectory, is a simple Graph visualization tool written in
    Python using the BGL bindings. It can load graphs, perform graph
    layout, run a few graph algorithms on graphs, etc. At present, it
    is not a useful program <i>per se</i> but merely an example of
    what can be achieved (quickly!) using the BGL-Python bindings. To
    use this program you will need to install <a
    href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a>.

    <h2><a name="rfc"/>Request for comments</a></h2> 

    <p><b>We want YOU</b> to send it comments, questions, bug reports,
    or suggestions for the BGL-Python bindings. They are experimental,
    used primarily in-house for rapid prototyping of graph systems. If
    you have any ideas, please post them to the <a
