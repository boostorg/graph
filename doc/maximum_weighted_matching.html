<a name="sec:weighted_matching">Before you continue, it is recommended to read
about <a href="./maximum_matching.html">maximal cardinality matching</a> first.
A <i>maximum weighted matching</i> of an edge-weighted graph is a matching
for which the sum of the weights of the edges is maximum.
Two different matchings (edges in the matching are colored blue) in the same graph are illustrated below.
The matching on the left is a maximum cardinality matching of size 8 and a maximal
weighted matching of weight sum 30, meaning that is has maximum size over all matchings in the graph
and its weight sum can't be increased by adding edges.
The matching on the right is a maximum weighted matching of size 7 and weight sum 38, meaning that it has maximum
weight sum over all matchings in the graph.

<p>
Both <tt>maximum_weighted_matching</tt> and
<tt>brute_force_maximum_weighted_matching</tt> find a
maximum weighted matching in any undirected graph. The matching is returned in a
<tt>MateMap</tt>, which is a
<a href="../../property_map/doc/ReadWritePropertyMap.html">ReadWritePropertyMap</a>
that maps vertices to vertices. In the mapping returned, each vertex is either mapped
to the vertex it's matched to, or to <tt>graph_traits&lt;Graph&gt;::null_vertex()</tt> if it
doesn't participate in the matching.
</p>

<h3>Algorithm Description</h3>

<p>
The maximum weighted matching problem was solved by Edmonds in
[<a href="bibliography.html#edmonds65:_max_weighted_match">74</a>].
Subsequently, Gabow [<a href="bibliography.html#gabow76">75</a>] and
Lawler [<a href="bibliography.html#lawler76:_comb_opt">20</a>] developed methods
to reduce the run time from <i>O(V<sup>4</sup>)</i> to <i>O(V<sup>3</sup>)</i>.
The implementation of <tt>maximum_weighted_matching</tt> follows a description
of the <i>O(V<sup>3</sup>)</i> algorithm by Galil [<a href="bibliography.html#galil86">77</a>].
</p>

<p>
Starting from an empty matching, the algorithm repeatedly augments the matching until no further improvement is possible.
Alternating trees and blossoms are used to find an augmenting path, in a way that is similar to maximum cardinality matching.
A linear programming technique is used to ensure that the selected augmenting path has maximum weight.
This involves assigning dual variables to vertices and blossoms, and computing slack values for edges.
</p>

<p>
The outline of the algorithm is as follows:
</p>

<ol start="0">
<li>Start with an empty matching and initialize dual variables to half of the maximum edge weight.</li>
<li>(Labeling) Root an alternate tree at each non-matched vertex, and proceed to construct alternate trees by labeling, using only edges with zero slack value.
If an augmenting path is found, go to step 2. If a blossom is formed, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4. </li>
<li>(Augmentation) Find the augmenting path, tracing the path through shrunken blossoms. Augment the matching.
Deconstruct and unlabel the alternating trees traversed by the augmenting path.
Go to step 1.</li>
<li>(Blossoming) Identify the blossoms in the alternating cycle and shrink these into a newly formed blossom.
Return to step 1.</li>
<li>(Updating dual variables) Adjust the dual variables based on the primal-dual method.
If this enables further growth of the alternating trees, return to step 1.
Otherwise, halt the algorithm; the matching has maximum weight.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The implementation deviates from the description in [<a href="bibliography.html#galil86">77</a>] on a few points:
</p>

<ul>
<li>After augmenting the matching, blossoms with zero dual are not expanded right away.
Expanding such blossoms is correct, but potentially unnecessary.
If expansion is required, it will eventually happen by assigning label T and going through a zero-delta dual update.</li>
<li>After augmenting, labels and alternating trees are reused for the next round.
Labels are erased only from the two alternating trees that are touched by the augmenting path.
Although this strategy does not change the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm, it appears to provide a significant speedup for random graphs.</li>
<li>The algorithm keeps track of the minimum-slack edge <i>e<sub>k,l</sub></i> for each pair of blossoms.
Storing these edges in a 2-dimensional array would increase the space complexity to <i>O(V<sup>2</sup>)</i>.
This is avoided by storing each row of the array as a list <tt>best_edge_set</tt> that contains only the non-empty elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If edge weights are integers, the algorithm uses only integer computations.
This is achieved by internally multiplying edge weights by 2, which ensures that all dual variables are also integers.
</p>

<p>
In addition, a brute-force implementation <tt>brute_force_maximum_weighted_matching</tt> is provided.
This algorithm simply searches all possible matchings and selects one with the maximum weight sum.
</p>

</p><h3>Where Defined</h3>

<p>
<a href="../../../boost/graph/maximum_weighted_matching.hpp"><tt>boost/graph/maximum_weighted_matching.hpp</tt></a>
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

IN: <tt>const Graph&amp; g</tt>
<blockquote>
An undirected graph. The graph type must be a model of
<a href="VertexAndEdgeListGraph.html">Vertex and Edge List Graph</a> and
<a href="IncidenceGraph.html">Incidence Graph</a>.
The graph may not contain parallel edges.
</blockquote>

IN: <tt>VertexIndexMap vm</tt>
<blockquote>
Must be a model of <a href="../../property_map/doc/ReadablePropertyMap.html">ReadablePropertyMap</a>,
mapping vertices to integer indices in the range <tt>[0, num_vertices(g))</tt>.
If this parameter is not explicitly specified, it is obtained from the internal vertex property of the graph
by calling <tt>get(vertex_index, g)</tt>.
</blockquote>

IN: <tt>EdgeWeightMap weights</tt>
<blockquote>
Must be a model of <a href="../../property_map/doc/ReadablePropertyMap.html">ReadablePropertyMap</a>, mapping edges to weights.
Edge weights must be integers or floating point values.
If this parameter is not explicitly specified, it is obtained from the internal edge property of the graph
by calling <tt>get(edge_weight, g)</tt>.
</blockquote>

OUT: <tt>MateMap mate</tt>
<blockquote>
Must be a model of <a href="../../property_map/doc/ReadWritePropertyMap.html">ReadWritePropertyMap</a>, mapping
vertices to vertices. For any vertex v in the graph, <tt>get(mate,v)</tt> will be the vertex that v is matched to, or
<tt>graph_traits<Graph>::null_vertex()</tt> if v isn't matched.
</blockquote>

<h3>Complexity</h3>

<p>
Let <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> be the number of edges and vertices in the input graph, respectively. Assuming the
<tt>VertexIndexMap</tt> and <tt>EdgeWeightMap</tt> both provide constant-time lookup, the time complexity for
<tt>maximum_weighted_matching</tt> is <i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i>.
For <tt>brute_force_maximum_weighted_matching</tt>, the time complexity is exponential in <i>m</i>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the best known time complexity for maximum weighted matching in general graph
is <i>O(nm+n<sup>2</sup>log(n))</i> by [<a href="bibliography.html#gabow90">76</a>], but relies on an
efficient algorithm for solving nearest ancestor problem on trees, which is not provided in Boost C++ libraries.
</p>
