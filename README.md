Boost Graph Library  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/graph.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/boostorg/graph)
===================

A generic interface for traversing graphs, using C++ templates.

The full documentation is available on [boost.org](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/graph/doc/index.html).

You can submit your changes through a [pull request](https://github.com/boostorg/graph/pulls). One of the maintainers will take a look (remember that it can take some time).

There is no mailing-list specific to Boost Graph, although you can use the general-purpose Boost [mailing-list](http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost-users) using the tag [graph].

Clone the whole boost project, which includes the individual Boost projects as submodules ([see boost+git doc](https://github.com/boostorg/boost/wiki/Getting-Started)):

    git clone https://github.com/boostorg/boost
    cd boost
    git submodule update --init

The Boost Graph Library is located in `libs/graph/`.

Boost Graph Library is mostly made of headers but also contains some compiled components. Here are the build commands:

    ./bootstrap.sh            <- compile b2
    ./b2 headers              <- just installs headers
    ./b2                      <- build compiled components

**Note:** The Boost Graph Library cannot currently be built outside of Boost itself.

### Running tests ###
First, make sure you are in `libs/graph/test`.
You can either run all the 300+ tests listed in `Jamfile.v2` or run a single test:

    ../../../b2                        <- run all tests
    ../../../b2 cycle_canceling_test   <- single test

You can also check the [regression tests reports](http://beta.boost.org/development/tests/develop/developer/graph.html).
